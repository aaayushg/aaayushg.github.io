I'm a **PhD** candidate in **Computational Chemistry** at **University of Illinois at Chicago**

My research interests involve integration of **machine learning** with next-generation **quantum and classical molecular modeling**. Versatile skills in computer programming, data science, and building Linux servers and GPUs. Strong experience in developing computational methods for drug discovery and sampling protein structures. **Entrepreneurial plus independent research skills** from framing new ideas, building prototypes to documenting in peer-reviewed journals. Track record of first-author publications in peer-reviewer journals. Passionate about learning and implementing novel and challenging techniques that are advancing the science.

When not researching, I am a self proclaimed chef - loves to fuse-cook different cuisines. In sports, I play Badminton and a frequent Marathon runner. Great at playing Poker (Champion @ Schrodinger Poker Night'2019)
