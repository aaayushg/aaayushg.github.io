Aayush is an innovative AI computational chemist with over 9 years of combined academic and industrial experience.
His research focus is at the nexus of AI, Physics and Chemistry, he seamlessly integrates AI into advanced quantum
and classical molecular modeling. He is proficient in machine learning, programming, and data science, and is well-
versed with AWS, Linux servers, and GPUs. Aayush has a strong background in developing ML-based computational
workflows for solving molecular properties and protein-drug modeling. He has consistently displayed entrepreneurial
and independent research skills throughout his career. He has a proven track record of publishing as a first author in
peer-reviewed journals, showcasing his ability to generate new ideas, develop prototypes, and document his findings.
Passionate about learning and innovation, Aayush is committed to pushing “AI for Science” forward.<br/>
<br/>
When Aayush is not solving problems in computational chemistry, he plays poker (Champion @ Schrodinger Poker Night'2019) and watches/reads Japanese animes/mangas. Aayush is also a licensed drone pilot who creates aesthetic videos (see here and here). He also mentions himself self proclaimed chef - love to fuse-cook different cuisines. In sports, he loves to play badminton and a frequent marathon runner.<br/>
