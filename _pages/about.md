  <strong>AI Research Scientist</strong> at <strong><a href="https://www.exscientia.ai/">Exscientia, Miami, US</a></strong>
 
<p align="center">
  <strong>Computational Chemistry</strong> researcher with a <strong>Ph.D.</strong> from <strong>University of Illinois</strong>
</p>

Aayush's research interests involve integration of <strong>machine learning</strong> with next-generation <strong>quantum and classical molecular modeling</strong>. Versatile skills in computer programming, data science, and building Linux servers and GPUs. He has strong experience in developing computational workflows for solving electronic structure and protein-drug modeling. He has <strong>entrepreneurial plus independent</strong> research skills from framing new ideas, building prototypes to documenting in peer-reviewed journals (track record of first-author publications). He is passionate about learning and implementing novel and challenging techniques that are advancing the science.<br/>
<br/>
When Aayush is not solving problems in computational chemistry, he plays poker (Champion @ Schrodinger Poker Night'2019) and watches/reads Japanese animes/mangas. Aayush is also a licensed drone pilot who creates aesthetic videos (see here and here). He also mentions himself self proclaimed chef - love to fuse-cook different cuisines. In sports, he loves to play badminton and a frequent marathon runner.<br/>
