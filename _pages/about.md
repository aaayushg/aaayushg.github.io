**Computational Chemistry** researcher with a Ph.D. Degree from **University of Illinois at Chicago**

My research interests involve integration of **machine learning** with next-generation **quantum and classical molecular modeling**. Versatile skills in computer programming, data science, and building Linux servers and GPUs. Strong experience in developing computational workflows for solving electronic structure and protein-drug modeling. **Entrepreneurial plus independent** research skills from framing new ideas, building prototypes to documenting in peer-reviewed journals (track record of first-author publications). Passionate about learning and implementing novel and challenging techniques that are advancing the science..

When not researching, I am a self proclaimed chef - love to fuse-cook different cuisines. 
In sports, I play badminton and a frequent marathon runner. 
Good at playing Poker (Champion @ Schrodinger Poker Night'2019)
