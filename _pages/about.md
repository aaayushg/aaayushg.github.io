  <strong>AI Research Scientist</strong> at <strong><a href="https://www.exscientia.ai/">Exscientia, Miami, US</a></strong>
 
<p align="center">
  <strong>Computational Chemistry</strong> researcher with a <strong>Ph.D.</strong> from <strong>University of Illinois</strong>
</p>

My research interests involve integration of <strong>machine learning</strong> with next-generation <strong>quantum and classical molecular modeling</strong>. Versatile skills in computer programming, data science, and building Linux servers and GPUs. Strong experience in developing computational workflows for solving electronic structure and protein-drug modeling. <strong>Entrepreneurial plus independent</strong> research skills from framing new ideas, building prototypes to documenting in peer-reviewed journals (track record of first-author publications). Passionate about learning and implementing novel and challenging techniques that are advancing the science..
<br/>
When not researching, I am a self proclaimed chef - love to fuse-cook different cuisines. 
In sports, I play badminton and a frequent marathon runner. 
Good at playing Poker (Champion @ Schrodinger Poker Night'2019)<br/>
