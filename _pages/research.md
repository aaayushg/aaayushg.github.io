## AI Research Scientist | Exscientia, Miami, US
Working with the AI-ML team to expedite drug discovery by developing hybrid AI/QM/MM methods. Leading PhysicsML team (within ML team).
*   Discovered graph-based neural network potential (EXS-NNP) outperforming state-of-the-art ANI on coupled-cluster theory dataset, recognized as a significant breakthrough at Exscientia.
*   Enhanced efficiency of NNPs by reimplementing them for multi-GPU training and predictions, automated training workflow, and integrated for conformer generations and MD simulations.
*   Research project (10% innovation): "Fusing Force-Field Features within GNNs": Crafted a novel message- passing GNN architecture bridging AI & Physics, predicting fast and accurate energies/binding-affinity.

Bridging the gap between ML teams and chemists by actively engaging with medicinal chemists to refine AI models based on their feedback.
*   Projects involved: Diffusion Model Based Docking; to mitigate protein-ligand clashes.
*   Active Learning for Compound Selection: to refine binding free energy predictions,
*   Implemented a docking workflow to generate 3D structural features, and integrating these features with 2D ADMET models, resulting enhanced overall performance.
*   Successfully reintroduced Deep Learning based AI-based linker generation between two fragments, resulting in the submission of two molecules for synthesis and in-vitro assays

## PhD Research | UIC | Advisor: Prof. Zhou <br/>
* Implemented [generative deep learning](https://github.com/aaayushg/generative_IDPs) model to guide conformational sampling of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and to reduce dimensionality.<br/>
* Developed a ML-enabled pipeline for large-scale virtual drug screening using [clustering and deep learning](https://github.com/aaayushg/RPN11_inhibitors) in combination with physics-based approaches against RPN11 - a drug target for breast cancer.<br/>
* Designed an efficient workflow for hit-to-lead drug discovery by integrating a hybrid neural-network/classical potentials molecular dynamics simulations against COVID-19 main protease (MPRO).<br/>
* Other areas: Modeled electron transport in peptide helices subject to chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect and its application in protein-protein association.<br/>

## Research Internship | [Schrödinger Inc](https://www.schrodinger.com/), NYC Summer’19
