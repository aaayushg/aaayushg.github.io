## PhD Research | UIC | Advisor: Prof. Zhou <br/>
* Developed a ML-enabled pipeline for large-scale virtual drug screening using clustering and deep learning in combination with physics-based approaches against RPN11 - a drug target for breast cancer.<br/>
* Designed an efficient workflow for hit-to-lead drug discovery by integrating a hybrid neural-network/classical potentials molecular dynamics simulations against COVID-19 main protease (MPRO).<br/>
* Implementing generative neural-network based protocol to mine conformational space of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and to reduce dimensionality.<br/>
* Other areas: Modeling electron transport in peptide helices subject to chirality induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect and its application in protein-protein association.<br/>

## Research Internship | Schrödinger Inc, NYC Summer’19
* Evaluated performance of deep neural network potentials (ANI) to achieve DFT accuracy at force-field speed (100x) for small molecule crystal polymorph prediction. Reported 98% DFT-ANI correlation in prediction. <br/>
* Analyzed potential energy surfaces of 100 different crystal structures (over 500 polymorphs) using DFT/ANI-1 potentials and identified their experimental stable forms (from exhaustive literature search).<br/>

## Research Assistant | UIC | Advisor Dr. Petr Král Aug’16-Dec’17 <br/>
* Performed quantum chemistry calculations <br/>
* QM techniques used: DFT, TDDFT, QMMM, AIMD, PES, Electron Transfer, Molecular Orbitals, NBO, ESP, NMR, Spectra, QST2, CASSCF.<br/>
